# Hack Club SSGI

Hack Club SSGI is a developer community at my college and it is registered under Dept. of Computer Science Engineering. We built this community to collaborate on projects, increase gender diversity in tech and share knowledge in the community by gathering like-minded people and organizing workshops and coding jams. Conversations in my community are of mostly Web Development but there are many developers from Mobile App dev, Cyber Security, Open Source and Competitive Programming. We usually meet once or twice a month on Video Conference for Networking and some workshops. Hack Club SSGI was established on 30th September 2020, we started small with only 5 members and gradually we got around 170+ students in a year to join our Slack Workspace.
